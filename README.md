# ✈️ Flight Booking Microservices

A distributed flight booking system built using a microservices architecture. It features isolated services for authentication, flight inventory, transactional bookings, and asynchronous email notifications.

## 🔗 Project Resources
* **[📚 System Docs & Architecture (Notion)](https://flight-microservices.notion.site/)** - Contains High-Level Design (HLD), DB Diagrams, and documentation for all 4 services.
* **[🚀 API Documentation (Postman)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/45885092/2sBXVig9sT#d2b2a2e1-7f6a-4102-933c-01123b8d6443)** - API routes, payloads, and mock responses.

## 📦 Microservices Repositories

## 🏗️ Services Overview
1. **Auth & API Gateway:** Centralized entry point, rate limiting, and JWT authentication.
2. **Flight Search Service:** Manages airplanes, airports, and flight inventory with O(1) seat lookups.
3. **Booking Service:** Orchestrates distributed transactions (Saga pattern) and cron-based seat releases.
4. **Notification Service:** Asynchronously consumes RabbitMQ queues to dispatch user emails.

## 📂 Folder Structure (`src/`)
This project strictly follows the Controller-Service-Repository pattern:
* `config/`: Setup for environment variables (`dotenv`), loggers (`winston`), and message queues.
* `routes/`: API endpoint registrations.
* `middlewares/`: Request interceptors, authenticators, and payload validators.
* `controllers/`: Receives requests, passes data to services, and formats standard API responses.
* `services/`: Core business logic and external service integrations.
* `repositories/`: Database interaction layer using Sequelize ORM.
* `utils/`: Reusable helpers, standard response objects, and custom error classes.

## 🛠️ Local Setup Instructions

Each microservice follows the same standard setup process. To run any of the services locally:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory. To run the base server, it only requires the port:
```env
PORT=3000
```

**4. Database Setup (Sequelize ORM):**
Ensure your local MySQL server is running and your database credentials are updated in `src/config/config.json`. Then, initialize the database:
```bash
cd src
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npx sequelize db:seed:all
cd ..
```

**5. Start the Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
```
